# COMaterialEditor
aka COME

Your solution to editing materials.

## Features
- Quickly edit materials for clothing items, allowing you further customization.
- Swap/edit textures, change colors, manipulate floats. It'll do it all.
- Persistent, unlike others COME's edits are saved with your saves and presets. They're also loaded completely automatically.
- Made for best compatibility, even when using NPR.

No support for items that utilize free-color at the moment. They are a little complicated.

## Usage
You need to have COM3D2.API, preferably the version within CMI. Drop the plugin in your Bepinex/Plugins folder, then launch your game. COME's UI can be activated from the gear menu or optionally from a hotkey once configured and activated in the config or the ConfigurationManager.

Please note that if a label is yellow, it means this property has been modded and it will be saved and applied as is to items in the same category and the same material index. To allow the item to work freely, press the un-mod button, you should see the label return to black.

## Enjoy!
and don't abuse those meidos.
